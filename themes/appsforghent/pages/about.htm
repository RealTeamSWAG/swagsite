        <h3>Why Open Belgium?</h3>
        <p>Opening up Belgian knowledge is not a task limited to governments or data owners, it’s something we all can support and cultivate. Open Belgium is a platform to provide a voice to everyone involved in open efforts in Belgium. </p>

        <h3>Why a conference?</h3>
        <p>The Belgian stakeholders are widely spread online, embedded in their own community, scene or industry. We want to break open these different community silos and bring people together. Because that’s the real strength needed to open up valuable knowledge.</p>

        <h3>Why open data and open knowledge?</h3>
        <p>We believe that vibrant Open Knowledge commons will empower citizens and enable fair and sustainable societies. We aim to achieve this not only within the Belgian borders but inspire and get inspired by communities all over the world. We keep spreading the power of openness, hoping one day all public knowledeg will be Open Knowledge.</p>

        <h3>What is the Open Belgium conference?</h3>
        <p>The Open Belgium conference is a community driven conference about Open Knowledge and Open Data, hosted in Antwerp. It’s packed with interesting talks and discussions. We debate about the openness of Belgium, from a local point of view to a European perspective. We provide national and international keynotes, cases and workshops, bringing you up to speed on new evolutions and best practices. All this rounds up in a network moment amongst attendees and speakers. The Open Belgium conference started out as a part of the three day conference DataDays in Ghent. Today this is a yearly conference alternating between the three Belgian regions: Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels, keeping the voice of the open community in Belgium alive.</p>

        <h3>Situation in Belgium</h3>
        <p>Concerning open data,Belgium ranks 53d on the 97 countries on the Global Open Data Index in 2014. Which a big change since the years before, but we still need a lot more open efforts in order to catch up with our neighbouring countries. By joining forces with governments, public utility companies, private companies, citizens and non-profit organisations and through co-creation and have a physical meeting spot we hope to speed up this process of opening up valuable data and knowledge.</p>
