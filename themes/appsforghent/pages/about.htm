        <h3>What is the Open Belgium conference?</h3>
        <p>The Open Belgium conference is a community driven conference about Open Knowledge and Open Data, hosted in Antwerp this year. It’s packed with interesting talks and discussions. We debate about the openness of Belgium, from a local point of view to a European perspective. We provide national and international keynotes, cases and workshops, bringing you up to speed on new evolutions and best practices. All this rounds up in a network moment amongst attendees and speakers. The Open Belgium conference started out as a part of the three day conference DataDays in Ghent. Today, this is a yearly conference alternating between the three Belgian regions: Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels, keeping the voice of the open community in Belgium alive.</p>

        <h3>Who is organising Open Belgium?</h3>
        <p>This conference is organised by Open Knowledge Belgium, a non-profit whose main goal is to stimulate Open Knowledge in Belgium. We do this through different activities, one being Open Belgium. That's a platform which provides a voice to everyone involved in open efforts in Belgium. Opening up Belgian knowledge is not a task limited to governments or data owners, it’s something we all can support and cultivate.</p>
